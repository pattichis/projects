## Start Jupyter notebook

Open up a new Anaconda Prompt and type:

       conda activate pytorch
       jupyter notebook

## Basic operations

-   **Execute a Cell:** Click `Run` or simply hit `Shift-Enter` on the
    Cell.

-   **Run all from scratch:** Click `Cell` and then `Run All`.

-   **Save the current notebook:** Click on the disk icon to save your
    work.

-   **Interrupt long computation:** Click on `Kernel` and then click on
    `Interrupt`. This approach KEEPS ALL VARIABLES. Restart running
    after Kernel interrupt

-   **To run the rest do:** Click on Cell and select `Run All Below`.

## Restart up to a point

       To run up to a point: Click inside the last Cell
       Click on Kernel and Restart to lose all variables.
       Click on Cell and Run All Above.

## Exit after all computations are complete
**This process will lose all of your variables. You can only preserve
the current outputs.**

       Click on the disk icon to save your work.
       Click Kernel then Shutdown.
       Close the browser windows.
       Then close Anaconda Prompt.

## Emergency exit if Interrupt does not work after long wait
**This process will lose all of your variables. You can only preserve
the current outputs:**

       Save the current notebook by clicking on the disk icon.
       Simply type Control-C in the Anaconda Prompt.
       You may have to press Control-C multiple times.
       You can then click and close each tab in the browser.
