**Project Proposal Guide**

**I. Requirement for project draft approval**

You are **required** to have your project approved **after** submitting
the proposal. A meeting with the instructor is required. This meeting is not optional.

**II. Proposal draft document sections**

You are required to submit an ***IEEE paper draft*** with the following
**sections**. Failure to provide them separately will result in losing
points. It should be submitted in PDF format.

-   **Title:** Your title should include the paper type: **review** or
    **original method** or **tutorial**. For example, your title needs
    to be: *Original Method: A Web-based Video Image Analysis
    Method-name.*

-   **Abstract (1 paragraph):** Write a short abstract of what you would
    like to do in your project. I advice that you write the abstract
    ***after*** you complete the remaining parts of the assignment.

-   **Motivation (1 paragraph):** Explain why you have chosen the topic.
    You will need to make connections to the modules discussed in class.
    ***Make sure to avoid overly relying on material that has already
    been covered. Please look at future material.***

-   **Expected contribution (1 paragraph):** Explain what your original
    contribution will be in the proposed research. Are you implementing
    all of the code? Can you provide the source code for everything that
    you have implemented with clear indication on which parts of the
    code was done by others?

-   **Expected contribution against competitive methods (table):**
    Provide a draft table that should include prior methods that you
    will compare against. Specifically indicate which ***new*** feature
    or approach you will provide over prior or existing methods. You may
    want to finish the writing of this section after you complete the
    other pieces since it involves the use of validation metrics
    (specified below).

-   **Draft flowchart or pseudo-code (one or more diagrams):** Please
    provide a draft ­­­flowchart for the image and video processing blocks
    that will be used in your project. You do not need to understand the
    pieces right now. **You are expected to provide source code at the
    end. This is for assessment purposes only.**

    -   **If using Neural Net(s), you may need to make sure that you are
        meeting the requirements for hyperparameter tuning. Explain
        carefully how you are doing this.**

-   **Code (1 paragraph):** Explain how you will get or develop the code
    for your project. Give the language that you are using and websites
    that you will be using.

-   **Dataset requirements (1-3 pages):** Explain how you are going to
    collect your data. Where will the images or videos come from? Do you
    already have them?

    -   **Make sure that your dataset requirements are met as outlined
        in the document title Project Requirements**

-   **Data training and independent testing method (max=1 paragraph):**
    You will need to optimize your method on a training set while
    reporting your results on an independent data set (e.g.,
    leave-one-out, cross-validation).

-   **Method(s) validation metrics:** This is covered in the homeworks.
    Please enter your best guess if you are unsure and we can discuss
    later.

-   **Bibliography (1 paragraph justification):** Select relevant IEEE
    Transactions or high-impact IEEE Conferences or other high impact
    publications **with at-least one major reference paper published in
    the** ***last 3 years*** (see below) that are relevant to your
    proposal. If you are not using IEEE Transactions or CVPR, you need
    to provide an impact factor or the citations of the paper or a brief
    statement explaining how the references were chosen. Similarly, you
    will need to provide justification if you are only using papers that
    are older than 3 years old.

-   **Links or PDF documents for the bibliography:** I want to see the
    papers or links to the papers that you will be using. This will
    allow me to review them with you.

-   **Flow:** There needs to be a flow among the different parts of the
    proposal project. They should not contradict each other.

-   **Connections:** I need to see the connections between the different
    portions of your paper. You should not ignore how the pieces connect
    to each other.


**Project proposal assessment**

The goal of this assignment is to prepare you for a successful project.
This first assignment requires drafts of your material that will be
reviewed in an online one-to-one meeting.
