# projects
The goal of this repository is to support projects that use Python, AI, and Machine Learning.


## Recommended tutorials
You can access a self-paced image-processing-based introduction to AI and Machine Learning through this   
[GitHub developed by Prof. Marios Pattichis](https://github.com/pattichis/AIML)

For more advanced work, refer to the Google Colab notebooks developed for [Hands on Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp). You can install the demos locally on your machine using [his installation instructions](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/INSTALL.md). His book titled <i>Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Pytorch: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques To... Build Intelligent Systems</i>
can be accessed for free through [UNM library links to book, O'Reilly books, IEEE, etc](https://libguides.unm.edu/computer-science)

## Sample Projects
