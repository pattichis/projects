# projects
The goal of this repository is to support projects that use Python, AI, and Machine Learning.


## Recommended tutorials
You can access a self-paced image-processing-based introduction to AI and Machine Learning through this   
[GitHub developed by Prof. Marios Pattichis](https://github.com/pattichis/AIML)

For more advanced work, refer to the Google Colab notebooks developed for [Hands on Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp). You can install the demos locally on your machine using [his installation instructions](https://github.com/ageron/handson-mlp/blob/main/INSTALL.md). His book titled <i>Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Pytorch: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques To... Build Intelligent Systems</i>
can be accessed for free through [UNM library links to O'Reilly books, IEEE, etc](https://libguides.unm.edu/computer-science)

## Sample projects

<b>Audio classification by Benjamin Metzner</b><br>
This GitHub demonstrates the new required format for GitHub projects for ECE 551. 
There are separate modules for data loading, training, and testing. Refer to 
[audio classification project based on separate modules](https://github.com/bman222112/ECE551)

<b>Video segmentation using SAM (complete) and SAM2 (incomplete) by Brian McCollum</b><br>
This GitHub demonstrates the use of foundation models to provide ground truth.
It can be accessed through [video segmentation project](https://github.com/briyoon/ECE551-Video-Seg)

<b>Custom dataset for image classification by James Griego</b><br>  
This early GitHub provides essential information on how to build a 
[custom dataset for image classification using open datasets](https://github.com/jgreg4/ML-ImageClassify-Tutorial).

<b>Custom dataset for 1000 handwritten digit images captured by Raphael Perea</b><br>
This GitHub provides information on how to build a dataset based on your own images.
It can be accessed through
[custom dataset based on 1000 handwritten digit images](https://github.com/perear2/Custom-Dataset-Tutorial).

<b>Mars image segmentation by Ary Naim<b><br>
This GitHub provides an [image segmentation example](https://github.com/naimaryan1/LunarMUnet).
You can directly run the tutorial based on the [Google drive link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aiZMAFvt1e5_HM59oQ0EtJy6HIflzMpB?usp=sharing).
